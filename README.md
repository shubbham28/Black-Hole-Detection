# Black-Hole-Detection
It is a research paper published in Innovative Computing and Communication: An International Journal, 2019

In this project, I have modified AODV protocol in Mobile AdHoc Networks to prevent blackhole attacks where I have devised a modified algorithm by combing Cuckoo Search Algorithm along with traditional AODV Protocol.

I have programmed the project on ns2 network simulator and developed code in .tcl, .c, .awk files
